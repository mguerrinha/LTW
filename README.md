#### In the terminal, execute the following commands:

- If there is already a database.db file in the directory and you want to clean up the database:  rm database.db

## Comments about the Work

- User Feedback System, where operations such as adding products to the wishList or shoppingCart are accompanied by small notifications at the top left of the screen to inform the user whether the operation was successful or not.

- Admin account, which in addition to being able to elevate other users to admin, can create or remove categories and manage the rest of the system, from deleting all comments if necessary to deleting products.

- Simulation of a transaction for one or more products, where the user can choose their preferred payment method, delivery address and is then accompanied by a page where the user can save the purchase information.

- Users can search for the desired products using a search bar, the search is based on the name, brand or model of the product, a search that works simultaneously with the filters (price, condition and category) and sorting, i.e. regardless of the order of the choices, all the features work together.

- On a product page, it will always have comments associated with it, so that the buyer can communicate with the seller or give a review of the product, and only the owner of the comment or an admin can remove the comments.

- The user can, if they wish, save products they are interested in to a wishlist so that they have some way of saving them, as well as a shopping cart so that they can buy them. As for sellers in this situation, they will have all their products for sale available on their profile, and in the event of a sale, they will appear with the status "Sold".

- The seller of a product can edit all the details except the photo, category and condition of the product, as these are immutable parameters throughout the sale.

- In general, the website has a modern design, appealing to the user and easy to access, with the buttons visible and with an explicit meaning of their function.
